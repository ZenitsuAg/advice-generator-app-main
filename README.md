## Acknowledgments

- Melvin Aguilar -[MelvinAguilar](https://github.com/MelvinAguilar) Line 28 of his javascript main.js file helped me in my solution
  ```js
  { method: 'GET', mode: 'cors', cache: 'no-cache' }
  ```
  This helped to generate advice each time you click on the dice. The previous advice is not cached.
