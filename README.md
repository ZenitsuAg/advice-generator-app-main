## Acknowledgments

- Melvin Aguilar - [MelvinAguilar](https://github.com/MelvinAguilar) Line 28 of his [solution's](https://github.com/MelvinAguilar/advice-generator-app/tree/main/assets/js) main.js file helped me in my solution
  ```js
  { method: 'GET', mode: 'cors', cache: 'no-cache' }
  ```
  This helped to generate advice each time you click on the dice. The previous advice is not cached.
  
- I give thanks to you, God Almighty for your grace and continuous support. Without you Lord Jesus, I wouldn't have come this far.
